Description: The 'Postlight' 'Mercury' 'API' <https://mercury.postlight.com> takes any web
    article and returns only the relevant content - headline, author, body text,  
    images and more - free from any clutter and including only minimal markup. Tools
    are provided to access the 'API' and also further clean up retrieved text through
    the the application of 'XSLT' style sheets. An 'RStudio' 'Addin' is also provided
    which makes it possible to preview the cleaned content from a 'URL' on
    the clipboard.
